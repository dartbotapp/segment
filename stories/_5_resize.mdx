### Width & Height
Set the width of the segment using standard CSS. The component will automatically adjust its size
to fit the container.
<Canvas of={ResizeStories.Dimensions} />

### Dynamic Resize
Dynamically resizing the `<seven-segment>` element will automatically
redraw the board to <strong>maintain the resolution</strong>.
<Canvas of={ResizeStories.Dynamic} />

### Aspect ratio
By default the component will maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio when you set the width.
<Canvas of={ResizeStories.Width} />

You can change this by setting the `aspect-ratio` CSS property.
<Canvas of={ResizeStories.AspectRatio} />
